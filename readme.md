This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Disclaimer

This project is just a little exercise working with React, Node.js and MongoDB after watching a few tutorials on react.
I picked a random project idea and tried to create this project by applying what I read about react without following a tutorial.
It is not production ready and the code base is provided as is.

I decided to continue by implemting a backend, and with actually restarted a new project here: https://github.com/tomek-i/fitness-pal

My goal is to do a full web app for personal fitness goals, including API, authentication, user management, various data points and visualisation etc.
